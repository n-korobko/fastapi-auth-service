# How to Run the Project

## 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

* Docker
* Docker Compose

---

## 2️⃣ Build and Start Containers

From the project root directory:

```
docker compose up --build
```

After the first build, you can start with:

```
docker compose up
```

To run in background:

```
docker compose up -d
```

To stop containers:

```
docker compose down
```

---

# Database Migrations (Alembic)

Create a new migration:

```
docker compose exec app alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message"
```

Apply migrations:

```
docker compose exec app alembic upgrade head
```

---

# API Documentation

After the containers are running, open:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

Swagger UI will be available.

# Authentication Flow

1. Register user
2. Login with email & password
3. Receive JWT token
4. Use token in Authorization header:

The PDF contains:

* User ID
* Name
* Surname
* Email
* Date of birth

The file is returned as a downloadable PDF response.

---

# Features Implemented

* Async database connection
* Password hashing
* JWT authentication
* Protected routes
* Alembic migrations
* Dockerized environment
* PostgreSQL volume persistence
* PDF generation service

---

# Notes

* Tables are managed only through Alembic migrations.
* The database runs inside Docker.
* Data is persisted using Docker volumes.
